            You are incredibly special to me, not just because of the time we’ve spent together, but because of who you are. The way you see the world, the way you make me feel understood, the way you love with so much depth. Those things make you irreplaceable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to show you through my actions that I don’t take you for granted. I want to be someone who makes you feel safe, valued, and truly loved.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you. I want to be with you. And I’m willing to prove that to you.
