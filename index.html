        <p>
            You are incredibly special to me, not just because of the time we’ve spent together, but because of who you are. The way you see the world, the way you make me feel understood, the way you love with so much depth. Those things make you irreplaceable. And I never want you to doubt that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know words alone aren’t enough, and I want to show you through my actions that I don’t take you for granted. I want to be someone who makes you feel safe, valued, and truly loved, not just in the big moments, but every day.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter how hard things have been, I still choose you. If there’s a way forward for us, I want to find it. I want to rebuild what’s been broken, not out of fear of losing what we’ve had, but because I believe in what we can still be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you. I want to be with you. And I’m willing to prove that to you, not just today, but every day moving forward.
